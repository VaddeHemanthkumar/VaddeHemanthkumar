## üå± Currently Cultivating My Skills (BCA in AI)

I'm currently pursuing my **BCA in Artificial Intelligence**, where I'm rigorously learning and applying concepts in:

* **Programming Languages:** Python (my primary language for AI and scripting), Java, C/C++.
* **AI/ML Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn (eager to master PyTorch too!).
* **Web Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and exploring frameworks like React/Vue/Angular).
* **Database Management:** SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
* **Data Structures & Algorithms.**
* **Operating Systems & Networking Fundamentals.**
